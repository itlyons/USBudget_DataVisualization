# US Budget Data Visualization
[The Latest](https://itlyons.github.io/USBudget_DataVisualization/ThemeAndDesign.html)
This repository will contain detailed visualizations of US federal government spending and revenues over time. 

I am interested in explaining the following topics:
* Explore federal grants to state & local government. What are these funds used for? How have they changed over time?
* Show the effects of the Bush and Trump tax cuts on the revenue side. 
* Changes in how much we invest in in things like R&D, transportation infrastructure, and other long-term investments over the past decades. 
* Compare presidentâ€™s proposed 2019 budget to current spending levels. 
* Visualize in what departments and/or programs most federal money is spent.

Sources:
* United States Treasury Department
* White House Office of Management and Budget
