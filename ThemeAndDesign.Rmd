## Largest Tax Expenditures By Category
Tax expenditures are what we usually refer to as tax loopholes or tax breaks. The US Department of Treasury classifies these tax provisions as tax "expenditures" in recognition of the fact that they are "often viewed as alternatives to other policy instruments, such as spending or regulatory programs" ([Treasury](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/tax-policy/tax-expenditures)). 

In the United States, many policies act though the tax code rather than through fiscal policy. For instance, other developed nations generally provide health care and/or health insurance for all of their citizens directly though national insurance/medical programs. However, in the United States most people receive insurance through their employer, perhaps not even realizing the generous tax treatment they and their employer are receiving.

## The largest individual tax expenditures  
Looking at the largest individual tax breaks, it is easy to see the hidden cost of the American approach to health care policy. The deduction for premiums for employer-sponsored health care plans alone costs over $205 billion a year, according to the Department of Treasury. This deduction has also been blamed for pushing up health care spending in general by encouraging more generous plans with lower cost-sharing and [less managed care.](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-tax-exclusion-employer-sponsored-health-insurance-work).

## Annual Outlays 1998-2018 of Some of the Largest Agencies & Departments  
Note: I need to figure out how to add recession shading and add some events, such as the September 11th terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq in 2003.  

Departments have received differing treatment over the past two decades depending on presidential priorities and world events. We can see the effects of the recession on the highlighted departments. The Department of Treasury, whose outlays usually consist of interest payments, had to massively increase its expenditures in the depths of the financial crisis. The Department of Agriculture saw a stubborn increase in its outlays due to increased usage of SNAP, more commonly known as the food stamp program.  

The September 11th 2001 terrorist attacks and the subsequent invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq saw Department of Defense Expenditures soar, until hostilities started to wind down in 2010 or so. The Department of Homeland Security, founded in 2002, has consistently received \$50-\$100 billion per year. The increase in 2018 funding for both departments is a reflection of the Trump administration's priorities.

## Spending Over Time  
The share of federal spending classified as mandatory has grown as a percentage of total spending since the 1960s. 

Mandatory spending is spending controlled by laws other than annual appropriations acts. This spending has been mandated by Congress in the past and does does have to be reappropriated each year. Most mandatory programs are fall under health care (e.g. Medicare, Medicaid), social security, and other income support programs. Spending on mandatory programs is determined by the number of eligible recipients. 

Discretionary spending must be appropriated each year by the House and Senate. The largest portion of discretionary spending is funding for the Department of Defense and other defense-related programs. Non-defense discretionary spending, just under half of total discretionary spending in 2018, accounts for all federal spending on diplomacy, education, transportation, research, law enforcement, and paying for the operations of the federal government.

# Revenues Over Time

The federal government can borrow money, or collect taxes/revenues to finance its activities. Revenues can be collected from individuals or businesses, through fees, sales taxes, profit taxes, payroll taxes, or through tariffs- taxes on foreign goods. 

Since 1962, the proportion of revenue collected through payroll taxes and individual income taxes has increased substantially. The proportion of revenues collected through the corporate income tax and excise taxes (sales taxes, such as the federal gasoline tax) has fallen. The share of revenue from payroll taxes has increased from about 20% of revenues in 1962, to about 35% in 2018. Individual income taxes have gone from a little over 40% of revenues to almost 50% of all federal revenue.
