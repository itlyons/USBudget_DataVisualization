This repository will contain detailed visualizations of US federal government spending and revenues over time.  


I am interested in explaining the following topics:
* Explore federal grants to state & local government. What are these funds used for? How have they changed over time?
* Changes in how much we invest in in things like R&D, transportation infrastructure, and other long-term investments over the past decades. 
* Visualize in what departments and/or programs most federal money is spent.

* United States Treasury Department
* White House Office of Management and Budget  
* Congressional Budget Office
